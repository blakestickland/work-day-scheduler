# Work Day Scheduler

## Aim: 

To create a simple calendar application that enables the userto save events for each hour of the day. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updatd HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Goals:

* Current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. This is dynamically updated each second to accurately reflect the current day and date. 

* Timeblocks for standard business hours are presented.

* When the user clicks on a timeblock, they can enter an activity (for that particular hour).

* Clicking the "save" icon stores the text for that event in local storage.

## To be implemented in the future:

* Fix column re-sizing that occurs when screen width is between 576px and 611px.

* Ne column to be able to clear an activity (and delete it from local storage).
